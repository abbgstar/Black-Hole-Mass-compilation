# Black-Hole-Mass-compilation

Compilation and code associated with the `Unification of the Fundamental Plane and Super-Massive Black Holes Masses' by Remco van den Bosch. Accepted for publication in ApJ. The preprint is available here [http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01246](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01246). Please cite this work if this datatable and code was useful.

A small amount of documentation is available in the msigma_fit.pro  which contains the code to make the keyplots from the paper.

The total compilation contains 294 galaxies, of which 230 are used in the fits in the paper. The selected keyword shows which galaxies are in the fit (1), omitted (0), or are in table 3 with missing data (-3), or are globular clusters from table 4 (-4). Changing the selection will directly the resulting regressions. This is expected behaviour given the heterogeneous data in this compilation. 

Feel free to fork and push changes. Or request additional information. Or find BH masses that I missed. :)
