# Black-Hole-Mass-compilation

Compilation and code associated with the `Unification of the Fundamental Plane and Super-Massive Black Holes Masses' by Remco van den Bosch. The preprint is available here [http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01246](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01246). Please cite this work if this datatable and code was useful.

A small amount of documentation is available in the msigma_fit.pro  which contains the code to make the keyplots from the paper.

Feel free to fork and push changes. Or request additional information. :)

Cheers,
Remco
